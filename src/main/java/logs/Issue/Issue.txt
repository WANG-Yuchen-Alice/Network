- modify a graph based on a fixed density?
- how to evaluate performance (density? signals? power?)
- rmax multiple vs rmax multiple full

something in between greedy (between one and all)
make rmax a constant
fix r, L, N => H, D
L: small, medium, large (5 10 20)
H: small, medium, large (7 14 28) = L * Math.sqrt(2)
H: longest hops of any point pairs (diameter)
vary N => vary the density(average number of neighbors) H: 2*diameter (more than enough)
density 3-10 (N*pi = area * (3+1))  //not sure
make the graph connected: check, keep adding new ones (until the graph is connected)

threshold : 1/di^2
can go through if pi > sum(else)
criteria: within the range, larger than everyone else

3 size: 7 different N (7 different density) fix r

1 person send (centralized), everyone sends(distributed).
