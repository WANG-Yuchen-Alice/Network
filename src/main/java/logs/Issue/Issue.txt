- modify a graph based on a fixed density?
- how to evaluate performance (density? signals? power?)
- rmax multiple vs rmax multiple full

something in between greedy (between one and all)
make rmax a constant
fix r, L, N => H, D
L: small, medium, large (5 10 20)
H: small, medium, large (7 14 28) = L * Math.sqrt(2)
H: longest hops of any point pairs (diameter)
vary N => vary the density(average number of neighbors) H: 2*diameter (more than enough)
density 3-10 (N*pi*r^2) = area * (3+1))  //not sure
make the graph connected: check, keep adding new ones (until the graph is connected)

threshold : 1/di^2
can go through if pi > sum(else)
criteria: within the range, larger than everyone else

3 size: 7 different N (7 different density) fix r

1 person send (centralized), everyone sends(distributed).

2 all go through,
check >2/3 always get through
check only the strongest guy

alternative (more senders, full)
once get all tags: always send
no data: always receive
in between: alternate

Quick Feedback:

- you should have a cover page, with title of project and your name.

- Put all section/chapter headings in bold.

- "working progress" should be work in progress.

- add some figures to explain your work

- you should have a short section.paragraph on the objective of the project.
