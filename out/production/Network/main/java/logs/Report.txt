Research Topic:
Improve network information transmission by varying the power of graph nodes.

Research phase:
1. AY19/20 sem2
Base line: greedy algorithm with a fixed r

2. summer break
Variations of r, mobile nodes

3. AY20/21 sem1
unstable graph with moving nodes
from centralized network to distributed network

Reference:
1. differentiate each signal from a network where there are more than 1 sender
CDMA
2. stop and wait protocol
3. randomized chosen r - half improved and half decreased performance
